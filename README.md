<!-- Explain what your extension does. -->

## Installation

Add solidus_square to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_square'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_square:install
```

### Creating a new Payment Method

Payment methods can accept preferences either directly entered in admin, or from a static source in code.
For most projects we recommend using a static source, so that sensitive account credentials are not stored in the database.

1. Set static preferences in an initializer

```ruby
# config/initializers/solidus_square.rb
Spree::Config.configure do |config|
  config.static_model_preferences.add(
    SolidusSquare::PaymentMethod,
    'square_credentials', {
      access_token: ENV['SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN'],
      environment: ENV['SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT'],
    }
  )
end
```

2. Visit `/admin/payment_methods/new`
3. Set `provider` to SolidusSquare::PaymentMethod
4. Click "Save"
5. Choose `square_credentials` from the `Preference Source` select
6. Click `Update` to save

Alternatively, create a payment method from the Rails console with:

```ruby
SolidusSquare::PaymentMethod.new(
  name: "Square",
  preference_source: "square_credentials"
).save
```

## Usage

<!-- Explain how to use your extension once it's been installed. -->

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'solidus_square/testing_support/factories'
```

Or, if you are using `FactoryBot.definition_file_paths`, you can load Solidus core
factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusSquare::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Updating the changelog

Before and after releases the changelog should be updated to reflect the up-to-date status of
the project:

```shell
bin/rake changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Update the changelog"
```

### Releasing new versions

Please refer to the dedicated [page](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/wiki/How-to-release-extensions) on Solidus wiki.
